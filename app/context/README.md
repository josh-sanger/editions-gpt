# Context Versioning
This Readme is meant to act as a time stamp so we can keep track of how the prompts have changed and what the outputs were for each set of prompts. If the [temperature](https://algowriting.medium.com/gpt-3-temperature-setting-101-41200ff0d0be#:~:text=Temperature%20%3D%201.0&text=Even%20for%20open%2Dended%20tasks,values%20between%200.7%20to%200.9.) is not mentioned in the change log, then it was the default temp (1.0).

  ### TLDR;
  This version removes the CONTEXT tool and instead ensures the completion API call has the closest 5 items (matches).
